Everyone is different, and that remains true for video games. Everyone has a personal prefrence and chances are there is a video game to match it. </h2>

            <p>Games can vary from anything you can think of. Horror games full of jump scares, virtual sports, virtual reality, the possibilites are endless. The best part is that companies are always trying to make new games improving on past mistakes. That means the games released now have been built upon ideas sometimes decades before the newest release.</p></div>
