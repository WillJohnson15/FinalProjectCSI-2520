<h2>Why We Chose Video Games</h2>
<p>COVID-19 has caused a lot of people to lock down in their homes. As a result, people are spending more times on their video game systems. Our website lays out multiple genres along with games that fall under each genre. Hopefully, we can help cure some peopleâ€™s boredom!</p>
<p>There is an abundance of gaming systems that anyone can pick up!
Featuring: PlayStation, Xbox, Computer, Nintendo Switch.
These are only a few, but remember some games are system exclusive.</p>
